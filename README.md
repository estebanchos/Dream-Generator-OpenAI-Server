# Dream Generator with OpenAI
Dream Generator is a web app that uses OpenAI's text completion engine to generate ecommerce store ideas based on a prompt.


Front-end repo: [Dream Generator client](https://github.com/estebanchos/Dream-Generator-OpenAI-Client "Dream-Generator client")

## About The Project 
* I wanted to work with OpenAI's API and explore their AI's brainstorming capabilities to generate ecommerce ideas.
* **The Idea:** People may have an idea of what to sell online but they might not know exactly how to do it. 
* **The Application:** Users need to provide a prompt, for example "sustainably grown coffee", then OpenAI's text completion engine would generate some ecommerce ideas, for example "create a subscription service to receive sustainably grown coffee" or "start a website that connects local coffee producers with customers".
* Dream Generator is a simple tool that allows you to brainstorm ecommerce ideas and you can save ideas on your browser.

## Features
* Generating ecommerce ideas based on what you want to sell
* Saving ideas on the browser
* Deleting ideas from the browser

## Lessons Learned
* As a Junior Dev I enjoyed learning how to work with a third party API.
* Managing third party API keys must always be done on the server side. API keys on React .env files are published when the app is compiled.
