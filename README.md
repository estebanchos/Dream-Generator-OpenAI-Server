# Dream Generator with OpenAI
Dream Generator is a web app that uses OpenAI's text completion engine to generate ecommerce store ideas based on a prompt.


Back-end repo: [Dream Generator server](https://github.com/estebanchos/Dream-Generator-OpenAI-Server "Dream-Generator server")

## Problem Space
People have ideas of what they would like to sell online, for example sustainably grown coffee, but they might not know exactly how to do it. I wanted to leverage OpenAI's text completion engine to generate simple ecommerce ideas, for example "create a subscription service to receive sustainably grown coffee" or "start a website that connects local coffee producers with customers".
Dream Generator is a simple tool that allows you to brainstorm ecommerce ideas and you can save ideas on your browser.

## Features
* Generating ecommerce ideas based on what you want to sell

## Lessons Learned
* As a Junior Dev I enjoyed learning how to work with a third party API.
* Managing third party API keys must always be done on the server side. API keys on React .env files are published when the app is compiled.
